# 🧭 T-REX Roadmap

This roadmap shows how T-REX will grow from an Excel file into a small web app, step by step.

---

## ✔ **Phase 1 — Excel Prototype (Current)**  
- Build Input sheet  
- Build Summary sheet  
- Basic tax flow logic  
- Make Version 0.1 stable  
- Upload to GitHub  

---

## ⏳ **Phase 2 — HTML/CSS UI**  
- Create webpage layout  
- Add form inputs (income, addbacks, etc.)  
- Style it clean and simple  

---

## ⏳ **Phase 3 — JavaScript Logic**  
- Recreate Excel formulas in JS  
- Display summary on the webpage  
- Compare JS output vs Excel output  
- Debug and refine  

---

## ⏳ **Phase 4 — Python Automation**  
- Export PDF summary  
- Export formatted Excel  
- Maybe auto-generate folders or files  

---

## ⏳ **Phase 5 — Web App (Basic)**  
- Host on GitHub Pages / Netlify  
- Add simple navigation  
- No database yet — just frontend  

---

## ⏳ **Phase 6 — Integrations (Future)**  
Optional, only when I'm ready:

- QuickBooks API  
- Xero API  
- Cloud deployment  
- User accounts  

---

## 🦖 Vision  
T-REX starts as an **egg** — a small idea inside Excel.  
As I learn more software engineering, it will slowly “hatch” and become a real tool.
